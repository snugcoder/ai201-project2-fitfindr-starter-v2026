The FitFindr planning loop.

This is the file that makes FitFindr an agent rather than a script. It decides
which tool to run next based on what the last one returned.

If your loop calls all three tools no matter what comes back, you have a list
of function calls. A loop looks at the last result before it picks the next
step. **That branch is the graded part of this unit.**

Build and test your three tools in `tools.py` first. Then come here.

    python agent.py          runs both example paths below

    criterion depends on), and when it gets something wrong the reason is
    readable in the pattern instead of being a model's opinion.

    What it gives up is phrasing it has never seen. "nothing over thirty
    dollars" parses to no price at all, and the run then quietly ignores the
    ceiling. That limitation is in the README rather than hidden here.

    TODO — build this, following the branch rule you wrote in Milestone 2.

      1. Start a session with new_session().

      2. Count the times round the loop, and call trace.check_iterations(count)
         on each one before you go again. It raises when the count passes
         MAX_ITERATIONS in config.py — see trace.py.

      3. Parse the query into a description, a size, and a max_price. Regex,
         string splitting, or asking the model are all fine — say which you
         chose in your README. Put the result in session["parsed"].

      4. Call search_listings() with what you parsed.
         Put the results in session["search_results"].

         ⚠️ THIS IS THE BRANCH. If nothing came back:
              - put a message in session["error"] saying what the user could
                change — "No results" is not that message
              - return the session
              - do NOT call suggest_outfit with nothing

      5. Choose an item — the first result is fine. Put it in
         session["selected_item"].

      6. Call suggest_outfit() with the selected item and the wardrobe.
         Put the result in session["outfit_suggestion"].

      7. Call create_fit_card() with the outfit and the item.
         Put the result in session["fit_card"].

      8. Return the session.

      • Trace calls. One per step. `trace.step("search_listings", inputs=...,
